  <p>The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island[1]) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometryThe Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island[1]) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described.
